DESCRIPTION

For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.

Steps Followed - 

1. Had a look at data as it was an High Dimensional Dataset

2. Looked for any inconsistencies in the Categorical Columns to address those

3. Look at Null Values in the Dataset and Dropped the Columns with more than 50% of Null Values

4. Target Columns was Highly imbalanced
TARGET  Counts 	Percents
0 	282686 	91.927118
1 	24825 	8.072882

5. Treated Missing Values for Categorical Data and Numeric Data using MICE Algorithm

6. Scaled the Data

7. Oversampling was applied to Balance the Dataset

8. Created a Neural Network.

9. Achieved Accuracy was of 80%
